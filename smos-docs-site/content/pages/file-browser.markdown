title: File Browser
---

Smos has a built-in file browser for easy navigation within your workflow.
You can find the keybindings to enter the file browser [under the 'Any' section of the keybindings page](/smos/keybindings#Any) or by searching for `browser` in the built-in help mode.

From here, you can switch between files and archive files.

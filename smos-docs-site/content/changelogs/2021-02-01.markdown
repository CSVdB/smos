## Added

- `smos`: The `browserSelectFirst` and `browserSelectLast` actions, which are activated by `gg` and `G` respectively by default.
- `smos`: The `convArchiveFile` function, activated by `<space>fa` by default. You can use it to archive a file while looking at the file.
- Nixos module tests for home-manager configurations. The home manager module is now an official deliverable.

## Changed

- `smos-archive`: The timestamp appended to the filename during archiving now includes the local time of day instead of only the day.
- `smos`: The contents of an entry are now aligned with its state and header instead of with its list indicator.
- `smos`: Fixed a grammatical error in the description of the `entrySelectTagsFromBack` action.
- `smos`: Fixed incorrect logic with respect to displaying an ellipsis when parts of an entry were collapsed and selected.
- `smos`: Drastically reduced the idle CPU/memory usage by turning off idle GC.
- `smos`: Changed the lister character `-` to a space for a cleaner UI.
- `smos-query`: Fixed that check violations would not show up in the work report if the user had not configured any contexts.
- Converted all test suites to using [Sydtest](https://github.com/NorfairKing/sydtest) and fixed three sources of flakiness as a result.

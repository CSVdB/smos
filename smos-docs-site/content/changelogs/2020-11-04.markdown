##### Added

- Static builds for all executables

##### Changed

- `smos-query`:
  Make `AllTime` the default period and `OneBlock` the default block for the agenda command instead of 'Today'.
  See the Note `[Agenda command defaults]` in the code for more info.
  The default block now also changes per period. For year-based periods the default block will by month, for month-based periods the block will be by week, for week-based persiods the default block will be by day.

##### Fixed

- `smos-query`:
  The agenda report now shows the "Now" line in the right place at night.

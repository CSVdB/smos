##### Changed

* `smos-calendar-import`: The rendered smos entries now all contain the description of the event as contents, instead of only the top-level event.
* `smos-notify`: You can now put the magic string `SMOS_NO_NOTIFY` into event descriptions to have `smos-notify` ignore the event entirely.

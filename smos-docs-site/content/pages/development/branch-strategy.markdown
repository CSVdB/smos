title: Branching Strategy
description: An overview of how we use git branches in the smos repository
---

The default branch of the repository is `release`, which points to the latest release.
There are two more relevant branches:

* `master`, which points to whatever is in the staging environment.
* `development`, which points to whatever is in the testing environment.

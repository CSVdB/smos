<h2>
  Introduction to Smos
</h2>

<p>
  Smos is a purely functional semantic tree-based editor to replace Emacs' Org Mode for Getting Things Done.
</p>
<p>
  In short:
  <ul>
    <li>
      What todoist would have been if it had been written by the people who wrote vim
    </li>
    <li>
      Emacs' Org Mode but without the emacs around it
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

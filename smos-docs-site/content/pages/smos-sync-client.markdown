Your can synchronise your workflow directory using `smos-sync-client`.
This synchronisation works with arbitrary amounts of time between synchronisations,
so it is perfect for taking your laptop onto an airplane.

A community sync-server has been set up at [https://api.smos.cs-syd.eu](https://api.smos.cs-syd.eu).

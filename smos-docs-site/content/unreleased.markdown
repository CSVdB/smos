### Added

- `smos-query`:
  The `entry` and `report` reports now support multiple output formats: `json`, `pretty-json`, and `yaml`.
  This should allow for simpler integrations.

- `smos-scheduler`:
  The `next` command to see when items will be activated next.

### Changed

- `smos`:
  Timestamps can now be deleted using the `timestampsDelete` and `timestampsRemove` actions.

The `smos` editor comes with some handy companion tools.
`smos-query` is one of those and it is a query tool for your `.smos` files.

The `smos-query` tool operates in the workflow directory.
See [the directories documentation](/page/directories) for more information.
The `smos-query` tool will only consider the contents of the workflow directory for its functionality.
